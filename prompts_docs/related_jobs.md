{{Variable}} (action, outcome, or solution): [if the user has already chosen a segment, fill in with the market of the segment, otherwise fill in with the job to be done or solution filled in by the user].



Process to follow:

1. Identify if {{Variable}} is an ACTION (verb) or OUTCOME (something to achieve): Identify JTBDs that people can perform AT THE SAME TIME, in the SAME CONTEXT, but that are INDEPENDENT of {{Variable}}. These JTBDs DO NOT contribute directly to the success of {{Variable}}. They represent additional needs that the user may have. Think about needs that may arise in the SAME SITUATION, but that are distinct from the main objective of {{Variable}}. Look for JTBDs that are unexpected or not obvious.
- If {{Variable}} is a SOLUTION (platform, technology): Discover what a person wants to achieve WHEN USING this solution.
2. Discover 20 Related Jobs To Be Done complete statements following the General RULES below.
3. Re-evaluate the Related Job according to the Specific Rules for Related Jobs, and discard any JTBD that breaks the rules.
4. Prioritize the Related Jobs to Be Done that occur most frequently with the {{Variable}}.
5. Discover Rewritten {{Variable}}: Rephrase the {{Variable}} with statements that provide alternative and better wording while preserving the original meaning and intent..
6. Discover Higher Jobs: Achieve functional goals
7. Ensure all found JTBDs are following the RULES below.
8. Give the final result.

Important General RULES for the jobs to be done statements:

1. Start the statements with imperative verbs. A statement is never just the verb, but rather a sentence.
2. The Jobs should be functional (functional action or expected outcome). It should not be an emotional job (like trying to feel or avoid) or social job (like trying to be perceived or avoid).
3. DO NOT use adjectives or adverbs.
4. DO NOT use conjunctions ("and", "or", etc.).
5. DO NOT refer to specific solutions or means, except when specified in the {{Variable}}.

Specific Rules for [Related Jobs]:
1. Related Jobs are jobs that can be done in the same context as the {{Variable}}, but are not the same job as the {{Variable}} itself. 
2. Related Jobs must be completely independent of each other, of the {{Variable}} itself and of the direct or indirect object of the statement of the {{Variable}}, even the Related Jobs often occuring in the same context. Same context means that jobs to be done can occur in the same place, time, or general situation, but not that one job depends on the other to happen or be completed.
3. Important: DISCARD, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, any Related Job that can be classified as a step towards the success of {{Variable}} itself, a desired outcome or success criteria for {{Variable}} or could be classified as a Higher Job of the {{Variable}}.
4. Give a justification in how the Related Job commonly is related to the same context of the {{Variable}}.

Result:

Use the template below for:
1. Inform whether you identified {{Variable}} as action, outcome or solution.
2. List all final Related JTBDs statements.
3. List Rewritten JTBDs statements.
4. List Higher functional JTBDs statements (Achieve goals) related to {{Variable}}.
