Goal: Identification of metrics of the segment.
Market Definition of the segment: [fill in]

`<actors of the segment>`
{list here}
`</actors of the segment>`

Process:
- Investigate metrics that can serve as indicators of the "systemic health" based on the impact and influence on actors from roles "Performers", "Indirect Beneficiary" and "Threatened" of the job to be done.
    - You should only explore systemic health metrics based on the impact and influence on the actors from roles "Performers", "Indirect Beneficiary" and "Threatened" of the job to be done: These indicators should have lower and upper limits (make your best guess) that define a healthy range. 
    - Systemic health should be a composition of leading and lagging metrics. Leading metrics tell us about trends and predictive signals. Lagging metrics confirm an ongoing trend and are related to measuring throughput and outcome.
