{{Variable}} (action, outcome, or solution): [if the user has already chosen a segment, fill in with the market of the segment, otherwise fill in with the job to be done or solution filled in by the user].


Process to follow:

Identify if {Variable} is an ACTION (verb) or OUTCOME (something to achieve).

If {Variable} is a SOLUTION (platform, technology): Discover what a person wants to achieve WHEN USING this solution in the Jobs To Be Done (JTBDs) statements. If the solution is a name of a specific product, rewrite to the type of solution instead of the name of solution. Use the solution as the context in the statements of the discovered Jobs.

Discover 20 Contextual Jobs related to {Variable}. These jobs are **activities** that people commonly perform **in the same environment and time frame** as {Variable}, whether immediately before, during, or immediately after {Variable}. They are **completely distinct and orthogonal activities** to the main Job ({Variable}), occurring in the **same situational context that influences {Variable}**, but **are not steps, sub-tasks, inherent needs, or direct outcomes of {Variable}**. They are activities that could be performed independently of {Variable}, even if the solution's environment or offerings **facilitates or enables them in some way**, or that arise as **parallel needs in the same situational context**, but **are not mere steps or sub-tasks for the successful execution of {Variable}**.

Re-evaluate the Contextual Job according to the Specific Rules for Contextual Jobs, and adapt or discard any JTBD that breaks the rules.

Prioritize and Rank the Contextual Jobs to Be Done. The ranking should be based on how frequently each contextual job occurs in relation to the main job of {Variable}. Consider jobs that happen right before, in parallel with (during), or right after the {Variable} job. Higher priority should be given to jobs that are MOST FREQUENTLY performed in close temporal proximity to the {Variable} job due to the same situational factors. Select only the top 10, ordered by this frequency-based priority.

Discover Rewritten JTBDs of {Variable}: Rephrase {Variable} with statements that provide alternative better wording while preserving the same original meaning and intent. Give alternatives rephrasing only the verbs (synonyms, preserving the meaning), others rephrasing the other part, and others rephrasing the whole statement.

Discover Higher Jobs: Achieve higher functional jobs that {Variable} contributes to. These are jobs that {Variable} enables or facilitates, but that are not the same job as {Variable} itself.

Ensure all found JTBDs are following the RULES below.

Give the final result.

Important General RULES for all the jobs to be done statements:



* Start the statements with imperative verbs. A statement is never just the verb, but rather a sentence.

* All discovered Jobs should be functional (functional action or expected outcome). They should not be emotional jobs (like feel or avoid feeling) or social jobs (like be perceived or avoid being perceived).

* DO NOT use adjectives or adverbs.

* DO NOT use conjunctions ("and", "or", etc.).

* DO NOT refer to specific solutions or means, except when specified in {Variable}.



Specific Rules for Contextual Jobs (show your reasoning about each step):



They are JTBDs that people commonly perform **AT THE SAME TIME (or right before or right after)** because of the **SAME SITUATIONAL FACTORS**, but that are **DISTINCT ACTIVITIES** from {Variable}.

For each proposed Contextual Job, break the statement of {Variable} in potential Jobs to be done and ask yourself:

a. 'If I completely eliminate this job to be done, can all Jobs related to ({Variable}) still be successfully performed?' (If not, discard)

b. Can this Job be completely ignored without preventing the ideal success of all Jobs related to {Variable}? (If not, discard).

c. If {Variable} is NOT a SOLUTION: Does this job occur at the same time and place, but addresses needs totally independent of all Jobs related to {Variable}? (If not, discard). If {Variable} IS a SOLUTION: Does this job occur at the same time and place, and is it a DISTINCT ACTIVITY even if it benefits from or utilizes the solution's environment or offerings for a secondary purpose **or is ENABLED by the solution's environment or offerings**? (If not, discard)

d. Is this activity **inherently part of the execution of {Variable}**, as a step, sub-task, direct need, or expected outcome *of* {Variable}? (If yes, discard). **Rule 'd' Clarification:** Is this activity essentially about **doing *well* or *optimizing* {Variable}**, or is it a **completely separate activity** that merely occurs in the same situational context? For example, for 'Work remotely from a coffee shop', 'Use headphones to concentrate' is about *optimizing* the remote work experience in the coffee shop, *it's not a distinct activity*. However, 'Buy a coffee to drink' is a distinct activity (although related to the coffee shop environment), as **the activity of 'buying coffee' is not inherent to the activity of 'working remotely' itself, they are distinct Jobs that can occur in the same situational context.**



**Distinctness Checklist for Contextual Jobs:**



1. **Separate Activity?** Is this job **truly a separate and distinct activity** from {Variable}? (Or is it merely *a way to perform {Variable} well*, or a step towards it?)

2. **Functional Independence?** Can {Variable} **be completely executed and functionally succeed *without* this Contextual Job**? (Even if the experience is less convenient or comfortable?)

3. **Independent Need?** Does this Job address a **need that is *fundamentally independent* of the core need addressed by {Variable}**, even if both arise in the same situation?

4. **Optimization vs. Distinction?** Does this Job primarily exist to **optimize, facilitate, or improve *the execution of {Variable}***, or is it a **distinct and separate action** that merely *coincides to occur in the same situational context**, possibly being facilitated or enabled by the same environment?

5. **Orthogonal Relationship?** If we think of {Variable} as a functional axis, does this Contextual Job represent a **functional axis *completely orthogonal* to {Variable}**, even if both exist in the same contextual and temporal space? (Think of orthogonal vectors, where the action of one is not a component of the other).
