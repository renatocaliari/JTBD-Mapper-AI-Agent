{{Variable}} (action, outcome, or solution): [if the user has already chosen a segment, fill in with the market of the segment, otherwise fill in with the job to be done or solution filled in by the user].

Process to follow: 

 1. Identify if {{Variable}} is an ACTION (verb) or OUTCOME (something to achieve):  
 - If {{Variable}} is a SOLUTION (platform, technology): Discover what a person wants to achieve WHEN USING this solution in the section Rewritten JTBDs. 
 2. Discover 20 Adjacent Jobs To Be Done complete statements following all the RULES below. 
 3. Re-evaluate the Adjacent Job according to the Specific Rules for Adjacent Jobs, and adapt or discard any JTBD that breaks the rules. 
 4. Prioritize and Rank the Adjacent Jobs to Be Done. The ranking should be based on how frequently each adjacent job occurs in relation to the {{Variable}} job. Consider jobs that happen right before, in parallel with (during), or right after the {{Variable}} job. Higher priority should be given to jobs that are MOST FREQUENTLY performed in close temporal proximity to the {{Variable}} job due to the same situational factors. Select only the top 10, ordered by this frequency-based priority.  
 5. Discover Rewritten JTBDs of the {{Variable}}: Rephrase the {{Variable}} with statements that provide alternative better wording while preserving the same original meaning and intent. Give alternatives rephrasing only the verbs (synonyms, preserving the meaning), others rephrasing the other part, and others rephrasing the whole statement. 
 6. Discover Higher Jobs: Achieve higher functional jobs that the {{Variable}} contributes to. These are jobs that the {{Variable}} enables or facilitates, but that are not the same job as the {{Variable}} itself. 
 7. Ensure all found JTBDs are following the RULES below. 
 8. Give the final result. 

 Important General RULES for all the jobs to be done statements: 

 1. Start the statements with imperative verbs. A statement is never just the verb, but rather a sentence. 
 2. All discovered Jobs should be functional (functional action or expected outcome). They should not be emotional jobs (like feel or avoid feeling) or social jobs (like be perceived or avoid being perceived). 
 3. DO NOT use adjectives or adverbs. 
 4. DO NOT use conjunctions ("and", "or", etc.). 
 5. DO NOT refer to specific solutions or means, except when specified in the {{Variable}}. 

 Specific Rules for Adjacent Jobs (show your reasoning about each step): 
 - They are JTBDs that people commonly perform AT THE SAME TIME (or right before or right after) because of the SAME SITUATIONAL FACTORS, but that are COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT of {{Variable}}. 
 2. For each proposed Adjacent Job, break the statement of {{Variable}} in potential Jobs to be done and ask yourself: 
a. 'If I completely eliminate this job to be done, can all Jobs related to ({{Variable}}) still be successfully performed?' (If not, discard) 
b. Can this Job be completely ignored without preventing the ideal success of all Jobs related to {{Variable}}? (If not, discard). 
c. Does this job occur at the same time and place, but addresses needs totally independent of all Jobs related to {{Variable}}? (If not, discard)
d. Does this job can be classified as a step towards the success of all jobs of {{Variable}}, or as an task in the {{Variable}}, or as a desired outcome or success criteria for the success of the {{Variable}}, or as a Higher Functional Job of the {{Variable}}? (if yes, discard). 

Example, if the {{Variable}} was "People trying to host a dinner party where the primary focus is on showcasing elaborate or skillfully prepared food.", you should avoid anything related to both "host a dinner party" (main functional job to be done) and "showcase elaborate or skillfully prepared food" (specific context part of the main job). So, "Confirm attendance of guests" should be discarded.

3. Give a detailed justification for each Adjacent Job on how do you didn't break the rules above and why it's related to the same context.

 2. List all final Adjacent JTBDs statements. 
 3. List Rewritten JTBDs statements. 
 4. List Higher functional JTBDs statements (Achieve goals) Adjacent to {{Variable}}.
