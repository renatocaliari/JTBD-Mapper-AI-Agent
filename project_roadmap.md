- Always read the instruction file inside prompts_docs as your specific prompt to execute each task and generate the proper result in the project folder.
- Use the table below as your roadmap
- Generate result files only when the relevant step is reached.

| [ ] | Discover success criteria | `success_criteria_needs.md` | `result_docs/segment_job_map.md` | 1. Iterate through all jobs steps in `result_docs/segment_job_map.md` to run the prompt of `success_criteria_needs.md` and discover all success criteria of each job step.<br>2. Add the result of success criteria of each step inside each related Job Step following the format presented in the prompt.<br>3. After the Market Definition and before the Job Map, include each item in a new line: "1. Define a roadmap guided by the Job Map below, refer to: \[https://calirenato82.substack.com/i/141637250/evolucao-da-solucao-roadmap-orientado-por-job](https://calirenato82.substack.com/i/141637250/evolucao-da-solucao-roadmap-orientado-por-job). 2.
