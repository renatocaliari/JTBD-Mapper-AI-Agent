{{Variable}} (action, outcome, or solution): [if the user has already chosen a segment, fill in with the market of the segment, otherwise fill in with the job to be done or solution filled in by the user].

Process to follow:

1. Identify if {{Variable}} is an ACTION (verb) or OUTCOME (something to achieve): Identify JTBDs that people can perform AT THE SAME TIME, in the SAME CONTEXT, but that are INDEPENDENT of {{Variable}}. These JTBDs DO NOT contribute directly to the success of {{Variable}}. They represent additional needs that the user may have. Think about needs that may arise in the SAME SITUATION, but that are distinct from the main objective of {{Variable}}. Look for JTBDs that are unexpected or not obvious.
- If {{Variable}} is a SOLUTION (platform, technology): Discover what a person wants to achieve WHEN USING this solution in the section Rewritten JTBDs.
2. Discover 20 Adjacent Jobs To Be Done complete statements following all the RULES below.
3. Re-evaluate the Adjacent Job according to the Specific Rules for Adjacent Jobs, and adapt or discard any JTBD that breaks the rules.
4. Prioritize the Adjacent Jobs to Be Done that most frequently occur with {{Variable}}, because of the similar situational factors. Limit to the 10 first ones.
5. Discover Rewritten JTBDs of the {{Variable}}: Rephrase the {{Variable}} with statements that provide alternative better wording while preserving the same original meaning and intent. Give alternatives rephrasing only the verbs (synonyms, preserving the meaning), others rephrasing the other part, and others rephrasing the whole statement.
6. Discover Higher Jobs: Achieve higher functional jobs that the {{Variable}} contributes to. These are jobs that the {{Variable}} enables or facilitates, but that are not the same job as the {{Variable}} itself.
7. Ensure all found JTBDs are following the RULES below.
8. Give the final result.

Important General RULES for all the jobs to be done statements:

1. Start the statements with imperative verbs. A statement is never just the verb, but rather a sentence.
2. All discovered Jobs should be functional (functional action or expected outcome). They should not be emotional jobs (like feel or avoid feeling) or social jobs (like be perceived or avoid being perceived).
3. DO NOT use adjectives or adverbs.
4. DO NOT use conjunctions ("and", "or", etc.).
5. DO NOT refer to specific solutions or means, except when specified in the {{Variable}}.

Specific Rules for the [Adjacent Jobs]:
1. They are jobs that can be done in the same context as the {{Variable}}, but they are NOT the same job as the {{Variable}}. They occur right before, in parallel, or right after the {{Variable}} because of the similar situational factors.
2. They must be completely independent and separate from the {{Variable}}. They don't depend on the {{Variable}} to happen or be completed, and is not part of the process itself when trying to {{Variable}}. They that can't be classified as a step towards the success of {{Variable}}, or an action in the {{Variable}}, or a desired outcome or success criteria of {{Variable}}, or as a Higher Functional Job of the {{Variable}}.
3. They don't start with the same statement as the {{Variable}} adding only a context at the end.
3. Important: DISCARD, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, any Adjacent Job that break these rules.
4. Give a justification for how the Adjacent Job is commonly adjacent to the same context of the {{Variable}} but does not break all these rules above.
