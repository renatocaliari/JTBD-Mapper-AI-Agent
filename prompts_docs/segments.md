Goal: Identification of contextual segments.
Job to be done: [job to be done chosen by the user]

`<factors and variables>`
{list here}
`</factors and variables>`

Define SIGNIFICANTLY different segments, interconnecting diverse and specific situational factors and variables, which most impact the outcome of the Job to be done.

The segments must be mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive and non-redundant.
Use the criteria below for prioritizing segments (the higher, the better, except for "Frequency" and "Barrier to Entry"):

| Criterion | Description | Evaluation |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Impact | Level of impact of the context on the Job. | Low/Medium/High |
| Demand | Volume of people performing the Job in the context. | Low/Medium/High |
| Effort | Level of effort when performing the Job in the context. | Low/Medium/High |
| Purchasing Power | Financial capacity to acquire solutions related to the Job. | Low/Medium/High |
| Ease of Reach | Ease of finding/segmenting the group. | Low/Medium/High |
| Frequency | Frequency with which the Job is performed in the context. | Low/Medium/High |
| Barrier to Entry | Restrictions on the entry of new companies in the market. | Low/Medium/High |

Process:
1. List 20 possible segments, briefly showing only the name, market definition and justification, without further data.
2. Filter or group into a maximum of 10, ensuring that they are mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive and non-redundant.
3. Prioritize the segments using the prioritization criteria.
4. Display the final list following the rules below.

Rules for each segment:
- Give each a representative name, easy for product teams to use on a daily basis.
- Define the market for the specific segment following the model: "{group of people} wanting to {job to be done adapted to start with the verb in the infinitive} {comprehensive context involved in the group of people}. Adapt the Job to be done and context, based on the name of the group, to describe in a super comprehensive way the relationship of the actor with the job and describe the market with this formula. Examples:
    - if the job was "Manage finances together" and the name of the group was "Family members with elderly people", then the market could be "[People] wanting to [manage finances together] [with their elderly family member]".
    - if the name of the group was "People who care for elderly family members" a bad market statement would be "People who care for elderly family members wanting to manage finances together" because two groups of people are before the verb "wanting", which should be separated one at the beginning and one in the job to be done. A better market statement would be "[People] wanting to [manage finances together] [with their elderly family member]".
- They have SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT needs that therefore demand totally different and customized solutions, even when performing the same Job to be done.
- Give a justification for the exclusivity in how you consider the group significantly different from the others listed.
- Highlight the top 3 desired outcomes (starting with verbs) + top 3 significantly different constraints compared to the other groups that have a major impact on the outcome of the Job to be done.
- Explore possible business and product strategies: do not focus on a specific solution or method, but at the same time give examples of them.

Examples:
## {Group Name, e.g. Remote Professionals}
Market: {People} wanting to {care for their mothers} {while balancing their work routine}.


## {Group Name, e.g. Remote Professionals}
Market: {Professionals} wanting to {work while working remotely}.
Justification: Remote professionals have different productivity, connection, and work-life balance needs than in-office professionals.
