Goal: Identify specific and actionable financial success criteria when performing a "job to be done".
Context:
Job to be done: [include here the market definition of the segment, if chosen by the user, or job to be done mapped] 
<segment: all info>
[segment chosen by the user]
</segment>

`<situational factors and variables>` [include here the list of factors and variables discovered in the previous step] `</situational factors and variables>`

 #  Statement Rules: 

 - Ensure that success criteria always start with "Ensure" or "Avoid", whichever is most appropriate. Use a positive phrasing to describe what the person want to achieve directly, or a negative phrasing (almost always starting with 'Avoid') to describe what the person want to prevent. Focus on distinct aspects of the experience and add specific context. IMPORTANT: Don't simply create opposing statements (Ensure and Avoid) for the same concept. 
- Ensure that every succes criteria is a desired outcome to reach the job to be done with success and measure that succes. NEVER specify solutions, products, brands, technologies, or methods in the success criteria statements, unless directly mentioned in the Job to be done OR makret of the segment. Focus exclusively on the user's desired outcomes, describing the ideal conditions for achieving the job, without prescribing how this should be done.  
 - Each criterion should be Specific, Objectively Measurable and Actionable. 
 - Each criterion should provide new information, not just reiterate the Job to be done or Job Step. 
 - DO NOT use conjunctions ("and", "or", etc.). 
 - Always avoid adjectives and adverbs. Avoid ambiguity. Use nouns and verbs. If you find it necessary to use an adjective, compare it to something concrete instead of using it in isolation. This helps to make the meaning clearer. Example: Instead of "Ensure a loud sound", it could be "Avoid hearing ambient noise" as the desired outcome may not be a loud sound.  
 - Beware of comparisons. Example: "Ensure the volume is higher than the ambient noise" fails to convey the desired outcome, so you should ignore and state as "Avoid hearing ambient noise" as the desired outcome.  
 - Criteria must be mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive and non-redundant. 
 - The result should be a bulleted list of several success criteria. 

# Prioritization Rules:

Order the success criteria based on the following factors:

- Lowest current satisfaction with the criterion outcome
- Greatest positive impact when the criterion is met
- Greatest negative impact when the criterion is not met
- Largest current investment required to satisfy the criterion (time, money, skills, people, solutions)
- Lowest current accuracy to satisfy the criterion

#  Process for Generating Criteria:
- Imagine yourself as the financial decision-maker (using the first person singular) performing the {job step} (if provided) to complete the {job to be done} taking into account the interconnection of diverse and specific situational factors and variables.
- From this, discover at least 20 financial success criteria statements by answering the question: "What conditions need to be met for me to resolve impediments, avoid any frustration and achieve the ideal financial outcome considering the situational factors and variables?". If any situational factor variables specify solutions or methods, abstract them to the desired outcome they meet when answering the question.
- Ensure to follow all Statement Rules. 
- Following the priotization rules, filter to maximum 10 and give details mentioned in the Template as the final result.
