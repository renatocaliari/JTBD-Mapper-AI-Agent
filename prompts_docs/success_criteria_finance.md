Goal: Identify specific and actionable financial success criteria when performing a "job to be done."
Context:
Job to be done: [include here the market segment, if chosen by the user, or job to be done] Job step: [focus on the specific job step, if provided, otherwise consider the entire job to be done]
`<situational factors and variables>` [include here the list of factors and variables discovered in the previous step] `</situational factors and variables>`
1. Process for Generating Criteria:

Imagine that you are the financial decision-maker (using the first person singular) responsible for {job to be done} taking into account the situational factors and variables.
From this, discover the success criteria by answering the question: "What financial conditions need to be met for me to resolve impediments, avoid any frustration, and achieve the ideal outcome considering the situational factors and variables?".
Justify how each criterion aligns with the situational factors and variables.
Exemplify solutions: For each success criterion, provide specific and detailed examples of solutions (mental, physical, virtual, procedural, or methodological) that can be used to achieve the criterion.
2. Prioritization of Criteria:

Order the success criteria based on the following factors:
Lowest current satisfaction with the outcome of the criterion
Greatest positive impact when the criterion is met
Greatest negative impact when the criterion is not met
Greatest current investment required to satisfy the criterion (time, money, skills, people, solutions)
Lowest current accuracy in meeting the criterion
Rules:

Ensure that success criteria always start with "Ensure" or "Avoid", whichever is most appropriate. Use a positive phrasing to describe what the person want to achieve directly, or a negative phrasing (almost always starting with 'Avoid') to describe what the person want to prevent. Focus on distinct aspects of the experience and add specific context. Don't simply create opposing statements for the same concept.
Each criterion should describe an expected outcome that is Objectively Measurable, Specific, and Actionable.
You can mention a specific circumstance related to situational factors or variables if you perceive that the need predominates, or exists mostly, in that circumstance.
Always avoid adjectives and adverbs. Avoid ambiguity. Use nouns and verbs.
If you find it necessary to use an adjective, compare it to something concrete instead of using it in isolation. This helps to make the meaning clearer. Example: Instead of "Ensure a loud sound", use "Ensure that the volume is higher than the ambient noise" or it would be better not to use an adjective and state as "Avoid hearing ambient noise" as the solution may not be to increase the volume.
The criteria must be mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive, and non-redundant.
Avoid mentioning specific solutions or methods as criteria (e.g., "writing", "bank accounts", "photos", "online", "WhatsApp", "spreadsheets", etc.), except if specified in the job to be done (and segment) itself or inherent to it.
The result should be a list of criteria in bullet points.
`<Format of each discovered criterion>`
{Detailed success criterion}: {brief explanation and say which variables of the situational factors the criterion relates to} - Metrics: {detailed count, proportion or average metrics with explanation of how to measure} - Current solutions: {types of existing solutions with examples of specific existing product-brands to use}
