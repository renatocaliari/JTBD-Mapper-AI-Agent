{{Variable}} (action, outcome, or solution): [if the user has already chosen a segment, fill in with the market of the segment, otherwise fill in with the job to be done or solution filled in by the user].

Process to follow:

Identify if {{Variable}} is an ACTION (verb) or OUTCOME (something to achieve). If {{Variable}} is a SOLUTION (platform, technology): Discover what a person wants to achieve WHEN USING this solution in the Rewritten Jobs To Be Done (JTBDs) section. If the solution is a name of a specific product, rewrite to the type of solution instead of the name of solution.
Discover 20 Contextual Jobs related to {{Variable}}. These jobs are **activities** that people commonly perform **in the same environment and time frame** as {{Variable}}, whether immediately before, during, or immediately after {{Variable}}. They are **influenced by the context of {{Variable}}** but are not integral steps or sub-tasks of {{Variable}} itself.  These jobs can also include secondary uses of the solution's environment or offerings, **and activities that the solution's environment or offerings ENABLE**, even if these secondary uses or enabled activities become primary functional jobs for some users of the environment.
Re-evaluate the Contextual Job according to the Specific Rules for Contextual Jobs, and adapt or discard any JTBD that breaks the rules.
Prioritize and Rank the Contextual Jobs to Be Done. The ranking should be based on how frequently each contextual job occurs in relation to the main job of {{Variable}}. Consider jobs that happen right before, in parallel with (during), or right after the {{Variable}} job. Higher priority should be given to jobs that are MOST FREQUENTLY performed in close temporal proximity to the {{Variable}} job due to the same situational factors. Select only the top 10, ordered by this frequency-based priority.
Discover Rewritten JTBDs of {{Variable}}: Rephrase {{Variable}} with statements that provide alternative better wording while preserving the same original meaning and intent. Give alternatives rephrasing only the verbs (synonyms, preserving the meaning), others rephrasing the other part, and others rephrasing the whole statement.
Discover Higher Jobs: Achieve higher functional jobs that {{Variable}} contributes to. These are jobs that {{Variable}} enables or facilitates, but that are not the same job as {{Variable}} itself.
Ensure all found JTBDs are following the RULES below.
Give the final result.
Important General RULES for all the jobs to be done statements:

*   Start the statements with imperative verbs. A statement is never just the verb, but rather a sentence.
*   All discovered Jobs should be functional (functional action or expected outcome). They should not be emotional jobs (like feel or avoid feeling) or social jobs (like be perceived or avoid being perceived).
*   DO NOT use adjectives or adverbs.
*   DO NOT use conjunctions ("and", "or", etc.).
*   DO NOT refer to specific solutions or means, except when specified in {{Variable}}.

Specific Rules for Contextual Jobs (show your reasoning about each step):

They are JTBDs that people commonly perform **AT THE SAME TIME (or right before or right after)** because of the **SAME SITUATIONAL FACTORS**, but that are **DISTINCT ACTIVITIES** from {{Variable}}.
For each proposed Contextual Job, break the statement of {{Variable}} in potential Jobs to be done and ask yourself:
a.  'If I completely eliminate this job to be done, can all Jobs related to ({{Variable}}) still be successfully performed?' (If not, discard)
b.  Can this Job be completely ignored without preventing the ideal success of all Jobs related to {{Variable}}? (If not, discard).
c.  If {{Variable}} is NOT a SOLUTION: Does this job occur at the same time and place, but addresses needs totally independent of all Jobs related to {{Variable}}? (If not, discard). If {{Variable}} IS a SOLUTION: Does this job occur at the same time and place, and is it a DISTINCT ACTIVITY even if it benefits from or utilizes the solution's environment or offerings for a secondary purpose **or is ENABLED by the solution's environment or offerings**? (If not, discard)
d.  Is this job a step, sub-task, need, desired outcome, or Higher Functional Job of {{Variable}} (Listen to music while training) itself? (If yes, discard). **Rule 'd' Clarification:** Is this job a **necessary step, a direct sub-task, an inherent need, a desired outcome *of* {{Variable}} itself, or a Higher Functional Job of {{Variable}}?  (If yes, discard). For example, for 'Listen to music while training', **'Adjust music volume' is too closely related, like a sub-task to optimize the listening experience, not a distinct contextual job.** However, **'Drink water during training' is distinct; it's a separate need arising in the same context, but not a part of 'listening to music' itself.**

**Distinctness Checklist for Contextual Jobs:**

*   Is this job truly a *separate activity* from {{Variable}}? (Or is it just a part of doing {{Variable}} well?)
*   Can {{Variable}} be fundamentally performed *without* this contextual job? (Even if the experience is less optimal?)
*   Is this job addressing a need that is *independent* of the core need addressed by {{Variable}}, even if it arises in the same situation?
*   Is this job primarily about *optimizing* or *enhancing* {{Variable}}, or is it a distinct action that happens to occur nearby in context **and potentially enabled by the context**?

Give a detailed justification for each Contextual Job on how you didn't break the rules above and why it's related to the same context of {{Variable}}.
