# JTBD Mapper AI Agent ü§ñ Free & Open-Source
_*Remember to periodically check for a new version_

## Important:
Although the entire process is open-source and includes a step-by-step guide on how to use it, after some feedback, I realize it‚Äôs not an easy system to run for at least two reasons:
- 1) Technical knowledge of technology is required: setting up tools, LLMs, monitoring the process in VS Code, and ensuring everything is running smoothly.<br>
- 2) Knowledge of Jobs To Be Done is required: many people struggle to evaluate whether the results generated by the agent are good enough and what to ask the agent to redo. Maybe it‚Äôs not easy to extract the best results on your own.

Therefore, if you need help with Jobs To Be Done mapping, feel free to message me on LinkedIn. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that I can also offer advisory or consulting services using the tool itself.

---

The "JTBD Mapper AI Agent" is designed to provide a comprehensive JTBD mapping, covering the key aspects, but it's not meant to be the definitive end of the analysis. Think of it as a research partner that helps you quickly map out the landscape.

It's crucial to remember that initial research findings, whether generated by AI or humans, should be critically evaluated and continually refined through ongoing investigation as new knowledge emerge.

You can leverage tools like Google 1.5 Pro with Deep Research or Perplexity for focused investigations, enabling you to gather potentially more up-to-date and contextualized information by 
exploring a wider range of sources and perspectives. You can also use NotebookLM to organize this research, input relevant references from the previous investigation and data from research studies, and collaborate with others to analyze and interpret the findings.

These are just a few examples of tools and how they can be integrated to support the work. A combination of AI-powered tools and human expertise.

This agent uses seriously powerful large language models ‚Äì think Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, DeepSeek R1, Qwen 2.5, and Llama 3.3 ‚Äì that have been trained on tons of data. They can identify complex patterns and relationships in that data, which can be really helpful, even in specialized B2B contexts. They're great at finding patterns and making predictions, but they can also reflect biases present in the data they were trained on.

It's crucial to critically evaluate the results, just like you would with any research. This means checking for accuracy, considering potential biases, and identifying any limitations.
You can also refine the results by conducting further research with your target audience to validate and enrich the findings.

It's configured to work within [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline), a free and open-source extension for VS Code ‚Äî an IDE commonly used for systems development.
You can use free LLMs such as Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, DeepSeek R1, Qwen 2.5, and Llama 3.3.

With this combination, you can have an autonomous agent that performs mapping autonomously. 
It only asks questions to confirm options you want to proceed with to the next stages.

# Installation

1. Open your terminal. Search for "terminal" or "command prompt" on your computer and open the appropriate application.

- Check if Git is installed: In your terminal, type `git --version` and press Enter. If any result appears showing the git version, then you have git installed. Otherwise, you do not have it

**If Git is installed:**

- Clone the repository. Type it in the terminal:

```git clone https://github.com/renatocaliari/JTBD-Mapper-AI-Agent.git```

- Now, type the following command:

```cd JTBD-Mapper-AI-Agent```

**If Git is not installed (or if the git --version command doesn't work):**

- Download the ZIP File from this repository: Click the green ‚ÄúCode‚Äù button, then click ‚ÄúDownload ZIP.‚Äù
- Navigate to the desired directory: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you want to copy. For example, `cd ~/Downloads/JTBD-Mapper-AI-Agent` and press Enter.
- Extract the ZIP File: Find the downloaded ZIP file, right-click, and select ‚ÄúExtract All‚Ä¶‚Äú.

4. [Download VS Code and install](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
5. Open VS Code.
6. [Install the extension Cline](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=saoudrizwan.claude-dev).
7. Open Cline's settings, clicking on the gear icon. The icon is in the extension window, at the top on the left side.

8. [Generate an API key in Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to be able to use the LLM Google's Gemini for free.
     - Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
     - Click on Create API Key.
     - Select the project "Generative Language Client" or any other with a free-of-charge plan.
     - Click on Create API key in existing project.
     - Click on Copy.
9. Go back to Cline's settings and select "Google Gemini" as the API Provider.
10. Paste the API key into the "Gemini API key" field. Then, select the "gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-1219" model or a newer one, or any other you wish to try.
11. Click the File menu and then Open Folder. Find the folder you ran the script or cloned the repository and click to open the folder "JTBD-Mapper-AI-Agent".
12. In the Cline chat, click on "Auto-approve: ...". Check all checkboxes and set the Max Requests for 50.
13. Click again on "Auto-approve: ..." to hide that configuration. 
14. Then in the field "Type your task here...", type a message like ```generate a job map for "{your job to be done}"``` and press Enter.
15. Your maps will be generated within the `result_docs` subdirectory created by the agent in the main directory with this format: `{currentdate_and_time}_{job to be done}_docs`.

# LLM Alternatives

## Free
You can use other providers to try different LLMs, like:

### openrouter.ai: Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking and DeepSeek R1
To try Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking or DeepSeek R1 free of charge, create an API key at `https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys`. 

Then, in Cline's settings, configure the provider to 'Open Router'. 
Select `google/gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp:free` or `deepseek/deepseek-r1:free`.

Select `deepseek-chat` as the model to use DeepSeek V3.

# Troubleshooting

You might occasionally encounter an "API Request Failed" error with the message "Too many requests". 
This is a common occurrence with free usage plans, often due to rate limiting or resource exhaustion. To resolve this, simply wait a short period and then click "Retry." 

Google's Gemini 2.0 is a powerful LLM that is currently offered for free, making the occasional need to retry a reasonable trade-off.
