Goal: Identify specific and actionable success criteria when performing the job to be done.
Context:
Job to be done: [include here the market definition of the segment, if chosen by the user, or job to be done mapped] 
Job Step: {Job Step provided by the user, otherwise consider the Job to be done as a whole}
Role: {Role provided by the user, otherwise consider the beneficiary of the Job result}
`<segment:>`
[all info of the segment chosen by the user]
`</segment>`
`<situational factors and variables>` [include here the list of factors and variables discovered in the previous step] `</situational factors and variables>`
`<switchers quotes>` [include here the list of switchers quotes discovered in the previous step] `</switchers quotes>`

# Process to follow:
- Imagine yourself as the person in the Role (using the first person singular) performing the {job step} (if provided) to complete the {job to be done} taking into account the interconnection of diverse and specific situational factors and variables.
- From this, discover at least 30 success criteria statements by answering the question: "What needs to happen for me to successfully achieve my aspirational ideal outcome, considering all situational factors?". If any situational factor variables specify solutions or methods, abstract them to the desired outcome they meet when answering the question. Ensure to follow all Statement Rules.
- Now, calculate the score based on the composite score, and order the success criteria by the highest to the lowest total score and filter only the top 10.

# Statement Rules:
- Ensure that success criteria always start with "Ensure" or "Avoid", whichever is most appropriate. Use a positive phrasing to describe what the person want to achieve directly, or a negative phrasing (almost always starting with 'Avoid') to describe what the person want to prevent. Focus on distinct aspects of the experience and add specific context. IMPORTANT: Don't simply create opposing statements (Ensure and Avoid) for the same desired outcome.
- Ensure that every success criteria is a desired outcome in the Role perspective to reach the job to be done with success and measure that success. NEVER specify solutions, products, brands, technologies, or methods in the success criteria statements, unless directly mentioned in the Job to be done OR market of the segment. Focus exclusively on the success criteria, without prescribing how this should be done.
- Each criterion should be Specific, Objectively Measurable and Actionable.
- Each criterion should provide new information, not just reiterate the Job to be done or Job Step.
- DO NOT use conjunctions ("and", "or", etc.).
- Always avoid adjectives and adverbs. Avoid ambiguity. Use nouns and verbs. If you find it necessary to use an adjective, compare it to something concrete instead of using it in isolation. This helps to make the meaning clearer. Example: Instead of "Ensure a loud sound", it could be "Avoid hearing ambient noise" as the desired outcome may not be a loud sound.
- Beware of comparisons, but use it when necessary to avoid ambiguity. Example: "Ensure the volume is higher than the ambient noise" fails to convey the desired outcome, so you should ignore and state as "Avoid hearing ambient noise" as the desired outcome.
- Criteria must be mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive and non-redundant. Avoid any redundancy among them.
- The result should be a bulleted list of several success criteria.

# Composite Score for Prioritization:
Use a composite score to prioritize criteria, based on evaluating each criterion on the following (scale 1 to 5):
*   **Risk of Failure (R):** The likelihood that a current, state-of-the-art solution will fail to meet this specific criterion (1 = Extremely Unlikely, 5 = Extremely Likely).
*   **Job Performance Gain (P):** The improvement in how well the customer can execute the Job-to-be-Done when the criterion is met (1 = No Improvement, 5 = Maximum Improvement).
*   **Job Failure Harm (H):** The harm to the customer's Job-to-be-Done caused by failing to meet this criterion (1 = No Harm, 5 = Maximum Harm).
*   **Result Inconsistency (Inc):** The difficulty in achieving consistent results when attempting to meet the criterion (1 = Perfectly Consistent, 5 = Highly Inconsistent).
*   **Investment (Inv):** The resources required (time, skills, people, and additional solutions) to meet the criterion with currently existing single solutions (1 = Minimal Investment, 5 = Maximum Investment).

## FORMULA
Composite Score = (R + P + H) * (Inc + Inv)

## 30 Raw Success Criteria
- {Success criteria statement}

## Top 10:
#### {#Current Criteria/#Total Criteria, e.g.: 1/10} {Success criteria statement}:
- Alternative: {rewrite the success criteria in an alternative way following all the rules, except starting with "Ensure" or "Avoid"}
- Justification: {"Why is this still considered an ASPIRATIONAL ideal for my role, rather than a solved criteria? And why isn't it easily solved these days?}
- Score: {explain how it impacts each factor of the composition score}
- Metrics: {multiple metrics with detailed count, proportion or average metrics with detailed explanation of how to measure}
- Current solutions: {types of existing solutions (mental, physical, virtual, procedural or methodological) with examples of specific existing product-brands to use}
