Examples:
- To understand the differentiation between performer and beneficiary: in the case of a job to be done "arrive at a destination on time", the beneficiary is the passenger and the performer is the driver; in the case of the Job "Caregivers trying to manage finances together with a person under their care", the performer is "Caregivers" and the beneficiary is "Person under care".

Rules:

- If "{{Job To Be Done}}" describes the actor of the Job To Be Done, find out if it is the beneficiary or the performer and use the same actor for the related role.
- The names of beneficiaries and performers should be specific in relation to the Job To Be Done, but comprehensive enough to represent all possible groups that benefit from or perform the Job (Beneficiary or Performer).
- For example, if the Job To Be Done was "access written information", a bad actor name that would break the rules would be "Librarians" because it would be a specific group, excluding other possible ones. A good name would be "Readers" as it would cover several groups and is directly related to the job to be done. If you don't find a name for the actor, use "People".
- if the job was "Manage finances together" and the name of the actor/group was "Family members with elderly people", then the market could be "[Family members] trying to [manage finances together] [with their elderly family member]".
- The actor's name should be simple enough and work within the market definition: "{actor name} trying to {job to be done adapted to start with the verb in the infinitive} {comprehensive context related to the actor and job}. Evaluate the names using this formula. Adapt the Job to be done and context, based on the actor's name, to describe in a super comprehensive way the actor's relationship with the job, without any redundancy.
- Adapt the job to be done statement to the specific role in the market definition. For example, if the job was "optimize the user flow" and the Beneficiary was "Users", then the actor's job statement should be adapted to suit them, such as "Users trying to perform a flow in an optimized way".
- The actor's name should not contain redundant information that is already described in the job to be done or context.
- if the job to be done was "manage finances together", a bad group that should be avoided would be "People together" because when defining the market it would be "People together trying to manage finances together" and it would be redundant together.
- Avoid mentioning specific solutions, methods or technologies, unless mentioned in the {{Job To Be Done}}.
- Do not mention or refer to the names of the roles, e.g. Performers or Beneficiaries.
- Avoid mentioning/using possessive pronouns in the market statement and job statement of the Beneficiary or Performer.
