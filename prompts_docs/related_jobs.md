{{Variable}} (action, outcome, or solution): [if the user has already chosen a segment, fill in with the market of the segment, otherwise fill in with the job to be done or solution filled in by the user].

Identify "Jobs To Be Done" (JTBD) RELATED to {{Variable}}.

- If {{Variable}} is an ACTION (verb) or OUTCOME (something to achieve): Identify JTBDs that people can perform AT THE SAME TIME, in the SAME CONTEXT, but that are INDEPENDENT of {{Variable}}. These JTBDs DO NOT contribute directly to the success of {{Variable}}. They represent additional needs that the user may have. Think about needs that may arise in the SAME SITUATION, but that are distinct from the main objective of {{Variable}}. Look for JTBDs that are unexpected or not obvious.
- If {{Variable}} is a SOLUTION (platform, technology): Discover what a person wants to achieve WHEN USING this solution.

Important RULES:
1. Start with an infinitive verb if the result is in Brazilian Portuguese or imperative verbs if it is in English.
2. Be functional (functional action or expected outcome). It should not be an emotional job (like wanting to feel or avoid) or social (like wanting to be perceived or avoid).
3. DO NOT use adjectives or adverbs.
4. DO NOT use conjunctions ("and", "or", etc.).
5. DO NOT refer to specific solutions or means that did not exist 10,000 years ago (e.g. "write", "photos", "online", "WhatsApp", etc.).
6. Important: Discard any Related JTBD that can be classified as a step towards the success of {{Variable}} itself or a desired outcome for {{Variable}}. You want to find a separate Job to be Done that relates to the context.
7. Related JTBDs must be independent and non-obvious in relation to {{Variable}}.

Process to follow:
- Discover 20 Related Jobs.
- Re-evaluate the Jobs according to the rules, especially 6 and 7, and discard any JTBD that breaks the rules.

Example:
- Functional Job: [focus on executing tasks]
    - Related JTBDs:
        - Drink energizing beverage.
        - Optimize workspace.

Expected Result:
- Inform whether you identified {{Variable}} as [action/outcome] or [solution].
- List all final Related JTBDs, following the RULES above.
