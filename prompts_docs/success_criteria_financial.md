# Process to follow:

- Explore all possible solutions that could help the beneficiary complete {Job to be done}

- Assume the role of a Solution Acquisition Decision Maker whose objective is to **approve the most financially sound solution for the beneficiary to complete their Job to be done.** Evaluate each potential solution by considering only the financial implications **for the beneficiary when acquiring and using the solution.**.
- From this, discover at least 30 success criteria statements by answering the question: "What needs to happen to successfully achieve my financial ideal outcome?". Ensure to follow all Statement Rules.
- For each statement, confirm whether it breaks any of the established rules (e.g. Did you use an adverb or an adjective?). If a rule is violated, either adapt the statement or remove it.
- Now, calculate the score based on the composite score, and order the success criteria by the highest to the lowest total score and filter only the top 20.



# Statement Rules:

- Ensure that success criteria always start with "Minimize the cost of" from the perspective of the Financial Decision-Maker who is paying for the solution for the beneficiary.

- Ensure that every success criteria is a desired financial outcome for the Financial Decision-Maker evaluating solution purchase.

- IMPORTANT: Each criterion should be SPECIFIC to a solution, Objectively Measurable and Actionable.

- Each criterion should provide specific new information, not just reiterate the Consumption Step statements.

- DO NOT use conjunctions ("and", "or", etc.").

- Always avoid adjectives and adverbs. Avoid ambiguity. Use nouns and verbs.

- Beware of comparisons, but use it when necessary to avoid ambiguity. Example: "Ensure the volume is higher than the ambient noise" fails to convey the desired outcome, so you should ignore and state as "Avoid hearing ambient noise" as the desired outcome.

- Criteria must be mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive and non-redundant. Avoid any redundancy among them.

- The result should be a bulleted list of several success criteria.



# Composite Score for Prioritization:

Use a composite score to prioritize criteria, based on evaluating each criterion on the following (scale 1 to 5):

*  **Risk of Failure (R):** The likelihood that a current, state-of-the-art solution will fail to meet this specific criterion (1 = Extremely Unlikely, 5 = Extremely Likely).

*  **Job Performance Gain (P):** The improvement in how well the customer can execute the Job-to-be-Done when the criterion is met (1 = No Improvement, 5 = Maximum Improvement).

*  **Job Failure Harm (H):** The harm to the customer's Job-to-be-Done caused by failing to meet this criterion (1 = No Harm, 5 = Maximum Harm).

*  **Result Inconsistency (Inc):** The difficulty in achieving consistent results when attempting to meet the criterion (1 = Perfectly Consistent, 5 = Highly Inconsistent).

*  **Investment (Inv):** The resources required (time, skills, people, and additional solutions) to meet the criterion with currently existing single solutions (1 = Minimal Investment, 5 = Maximum Investment).



## FORMULA

Composite Score = (R + P + H) * (Inc + Inv)

## 30 Raw Success Criteria

- {Success criteria statement}



## Top 20:

#### {#Current Criteria/#Total Criteria, e.g.: 1/20} {Success criteria statement}:

- Alternative: {rewrite the success criteria in an alternative way following all the rules, except starting with "Ensure" or "Avoid", but starting with verb in the imperative}

- Justification: {"Why is this still considered an financial ideal for my role, rather than a solved criteria? And why isn't it easily solved these days?}

- Score: {explain how it impacts each factor of the composition score}

- Metrics: {multiple metrics with detailed count, proportion or average metrics with detailed explanation of how to measure}

- Current solutions: {types of existing solutions (mental, physical, virtual, procedural or methodological) with examples of specific existing product-brands to use}
