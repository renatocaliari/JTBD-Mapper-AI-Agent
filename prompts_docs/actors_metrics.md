Goal: Identification of metrics of the segment.
Market Definition of the segment: [fill in]

`<actors of the segment>`
{list here}
`</actors of the segment>`

Process:
- List "systemic health" indicators that will be used to evaluate the impact and influence on actors from roles "Performers", "Indirect Beneficiary" and "Threatened" of the job to be done.
- These indicators must have minimum and maximum limits (make your best estimate) that define a healthy and super realistic (!) range: from X to Y. In general percentage.
- They must necessarily be a combination of leading and lagging metrics. Leading metrics inform us about trends and predictive signals. Lagging metrics confirm an ongoing trend and are related to the measurement of productivity and results.
- Indicators should always inform within which time period / cohort the measurement will be for evaluation.
- It should always follow the models below, filling in all variables of the placeholders.

Indicator Templates (there are two possible):
- "Rate of [specific group] that [quantity of action-expected user outcome] in [period Y]. Limit: [minimum]% to [maximum]%.". Examples: Rate of members who saved at least one item as a favorite in the last week. Limits: 20% to 90%; Churn rate of paying users in the last quarter. Limit: 5% to 20%.
- "Rate of [specific group] that [quantity of action-expected user outcome: signal] after [primary noise action: noise] in [period Y]. Limit: [minimum]% to [maximum]%. Ex: Rate of Visitors who Viewed the Process (Signal) After Invitation to Follow Process on the Platform (Noise) in the First 96 Hours: 60% to 90%.

Result Template:
- Indicators - Systemic Health:
    - {Actor name} {...Indicators}
    - {Actor name} {...Indicators}
    - {Actor name} {...Indicators}
