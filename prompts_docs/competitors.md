Goal: Identify competitors when hiring a new product to get the job done.
Job To Be Done: [fill in]

Remember: Competition isn't limited to product, software, or service categories. Itâ€™s about fulfilling the job, regardless of the type of solution. And everything that holds people back from the new solution.

Show me:
# Competitors
- Current solutions: {different types of competitors and examples of specific existing product-brands to use}
- Inertia: {specific examples for each force: habits and attachment to the current solution, anxiety and cost of switching to the new solution, and also including hidden benefits}
