Goal: Identify specific and actionable financial success criteria when performing the job to be done.
Job to be done: [include here the market definition of the segment, if chosen by the user, or job to be done mapped] 
<segment: all info>
[segment chosen by the user]
</segment>

`<situational factors and variables>` [include here the list of factors and variables discovered in the previous step] `</situational factors and variables>`

# Process to follow:
- Imagine yourself as the financial decision-maker (using the first person singular) performing the {job step} (if provided) to complete the {job to be done} taking into account the interconnection of diverse and specific situational factors and variables.
- From this, discover at least 30 financial success criteria statements by answering the question: "What needs to happen for me to successfully achieve the ideal financial outcome and avoid frustration, considering all potential challenges and constraints related to situational factors?". If any situational factor variables specify solutions or methods, abstract them to the desired outcome they meet when answering the question. a) Ensure to follow all Statement Rules. b) Calculate and show only the final score for each success criteria.
- Now, order the success criteria by the total score (highest to lowest) and filter only the top 10.

# Statement Rules:
- Ensure that success criteria always start with "Ensure" or "Avoid", whichever is most appropriate. Use a positive phrasing to describe what the person want to achieve directly related to the financial aspect, or a negative phrasing (almost always starting with 'Avoid') to describe what the person want to prevent. Focus on distinct aspects of the experience and add specific context. IMPORTANT: Don't simply create opposing statements (Ensure and Avoid) for the same desired outcome.
- Ensure that every financial success criteria is a desired outcome to reach the job to be done with success and measure that success. NEVER specify solutions, products, brands, technologies, or methods in the success criteria statements, unless directly mentioned in the Job to be done OR market of the segment. Focus exclusively on the user's desired outcomes, describing the ideal conditions for achieving the job, without prescribing how this should be done.
- Each criterion should be Specific, Objectively Measurable and Actionable.
- Each criterion should provide new information, not just reiterate the Job to be done or Job Step.
- DO NOT use conjunctions ("and", "or", etc.).
- Always avoid adjectives and adverbs. Avoid ambiguity. Use nouns and verbs. If you find it necessary to use an adjective, compare it to something concrete instead of using it in isolation. This helps to make the meaning clearer. Example: Instead of "Ensure a loud sound", it could be "Avoid hearing ambient noise" as the desired outcome may not be a loud sound.
- Beware of comparisons. Example: "Ensure the volume is higher than the ambient noise" fails to convey the desired outcome, so you should ignore and state as "Avoid hearing ambient noise" as the desired outcome.
- Criteria must be mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive and non-redundant. Avoid any redundancy among them.
- The result should be a bulleted list of several financial success criteria.

# Composite Score for Prioritization:
Use a composite score to prioritize criteria, based on evaluating each criterion on the following (scale 1 to 5):
- Investment: The resources required (time, skills, people and multitude of additional solutions required beyond the existing solution to meet the criteria) with currently existing unique solutions.
- Outcome Variability: The difficulty in achieving consistent outcomes with the criterion (5 = very difficult to achieve consistent outcomes).
- Outcome Maximization (Job): The benefits of meeting the criterion.
- Consequence Severity (Job): The harm of not meeting the criterion.

Composite Score = (Outcome Enhancement (Job) + Consequence Severity (Job)) * (Investment + Outcome Variability)

- Explanation: {give a brief explanation}
- Reasoning: {explain how it impacts each factor of the composition score}
- Metrics: {detailed count, proportion or average metrics with detailed explanation of how to measure}
- Current solutions: {types of existing solutions (mental, physical, virtual, procedural or methodological) with examples of specific existing product-brands to use}
